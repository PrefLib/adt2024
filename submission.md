## Submission Site and Details
Submissions are invited on significant, original, and unpublished research on all aspects of Algorithmic Decision Theory. Papers must be at most 15 pages long in the LNCS format (including references). The formal proceedings of ADT 2024 will be published by Springer Verlag in the [Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI)](http://www.springer.com/lncs).

ADT 2024 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, has already been published in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. However, in order to accommodate the publication norms of the many fields that work on decision theory, papers can be submitted but not already published elsewhere (i.e., are under review) provided the authors note they are submitting for the non-proceedings track at the top of their submission. 

All papers will be peer-reviewed by a double-blind procedure. Therefore, papers must be submitted anonymously as pdf documents via the [Microsoft CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADT2024) system.

It is important and required that authors do not reveal their identities in submitted papers. Since the review process is double blind, authors must take measures to ensure that their identity is not easily revealed from the submission itself. Authors should include the submission number (as assigned by the conference system) in the author field of the submission, and refer to their prior work in a neutral manner (i.e., instead of saying “We showed” say “XYZ et al. showed”). It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public or has appeared on arXiv, provided the submission itself is anonymized.

**Submission Format:** Authors should consult [Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines), either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Note that at least one author of each accepted paper is required to attend the conference to present the work. Authors will be required to agree to this requirement at the time of submission. In addition, the corresponding author of each accepted paper that will appear in the proceedings, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, will need to complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form, through which the copyright for their paper is transferred to Springer.

You may submit an appendix of any length into the CMT system. There is a separate area in CMT for this, the appendix should be formatted in the same way as the main paper. Please not reviewers are not required to review the appendix so the paper should stand on its own. 

To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, ADT 2024 will accept two types of submissions:

**Submissions with full text in the proceedings:** Papers of this type will be accepted for either oral or poster presentation, or both. Each accepted paper of this type will be allocated at most 15 pages in the proceedings and there will be no distinction between papers accepted for oral or poster presentation in the conference proceedings.

**Submissions with one-page abstract in the proceeding:** Papers of this type will be accepted for either oral or poster presentation, or both. Each accepted paper of this type will appear as a one-page abstract in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper (on ArXiv or other service). This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in venues that would not consider results that have been published in formal proceedings. Specifically, the full version of the one-page abstract at ADT can be submitted to another archival conference or journal. Such papers must be formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication, at the submission time, but authors are required to write “submission without proceedings” into the author field of their paper (instead of author names), if they choose this category. Otherwise, it will be assumed, by default, that their paper is submitted in the first category (submissions with full-text in the proceedings).
