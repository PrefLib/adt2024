## About the 8th International Conference on Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT 2024)

The 8th International Conference on Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT 2024) focuses on algorithmic decision theory broadly defined, seeking to bring together researchers and practitioners coming from diverse areas of Computer Science, Economics, and Operations Research in order to improve the theory and practice of modern decision support. The conference topics include research in: 
  * Algorithms, Argumentation Theory, Artificial Intelligence, Computational Social Choice, Database Systems, Decision Analysis, Discrete Mathematics, Game Theory, Machine Learning and Adversarial Machine Learning, Matching, Multi-agent Systems, Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding, Networks, Optimization, Preference Modeling, Risk Analysis and Adversarial Risk Analysis, and Utility Theory.

**We've confirmed a great list of invited speakers: Tracy Liu, Herve Moulin, and Jenn Wortman Vaughan! See the [Program](./program) page for more details!**

ADT 2024 provides a multi-disciplinary forum for sharing knowledge in this area with a special focus on algorithmic issues in decision theory, continuing the tradition of the first seven editions of the International Conference on Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT 2009 Venice, ADT 2011 Rutgers, ADT 2013 Brussels, ADT 2015 Lexington KY, ADT 2017 Luxembourg, ADT 2019 Durham NC, ADT 2021 Toulouse) which brought together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas of computer science, economics, and operations research from around the globe.
