  * [Register to part at DIMACS in lots 59, 60A & 60B](https://rudots.nupark.com/v2/portal/eventregister/68467061-93a2-4199-8890-6305fb88dcf0#/events/registration/). Please note that this does NOT include lot 64 in front of the CoRE Building.

**Poster Presenters only:**  DIMACS will provide easels and poster boards, but you are responsible for printing and bringing your poster. The poster boards are 4 feet wide by 3 feet tall but can fold to accommodate some smaller-sized posters too. Because the boards fold, posters that are 3 feet wide by 4 feet tall do not work well. For vertically  oriented posters, 3 feet tall by 2 feet wide works best.

## Co-Located Events

**DIMACS Forecasting Workshop:** On Monday October 14th 2024, DIMACS will hold a workshop on Forecasting. In this workshop, we will bring together computer scientists, economists, statisticians, and decision scientists, some who develop theories of forecasting and others who study it empirically. We invite academics together with practitioners who build forecasting platforms, operate forecasting competitions, and publish predictions. Our primary focus is on what happens after predictive models have been trained or formed; that said, still in scope are data-driven and machine-learning-based techniques that aggregate forecasts and other information to harness the so-called wisdom of the crowd.

**A Tribute to Fred Roberts (FredFest!):** On Thursday October 17th 2024, DIMACS will hold a workshop in honor of Fred Roberts, co-founder and long-time Director of DIMACS who is also a co-founder of the ADT Conference. You are welcome to stay for that event. [More information is available here.](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/events/details?eID=2769)
