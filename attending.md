## Co-Located Events

On Monday October 14th 2024, DIMACS will hold a workshop on Forecasting. In this workshop, we will bring together computer scientists, economists, statisticians, and decision scientists, some who develop theories of forecasting and others who study it empirically. We invite academics together with practitioners who build forecasting platforms, operate forecasting competitions, and publish predictions. Our primary focus is on what happens after predictive models have been trained or formed; that said, still in scope are data-driven and machine-learning-based techniques that aggregate forecasts and other information to harness the so-called wisdom of the crowd.

Following the successful iterations at EC 2017 and DIMACS 2021, we seek submissions to the DIMACS 2024 Workshop on Forecasting. The workshop will be held on October 14, 2024, at Rutgers University New Brunswick, NJ,

On Thursday October 17th 2024, DIMACS will hold a workshop in honor of Fred Roberts, co-founder and long-time Director of DIMACS who is also a co-founder of the ADT Conference.
